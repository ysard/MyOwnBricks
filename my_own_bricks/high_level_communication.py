def get_device_messages():
    """Coroutine for device responses

    It's a wrapper that fully encapsulates the LEGO UART protocol. The user the
    user only has to provide the desired modes and eventually the data to be
    sent to the device.
    This function is blocking until a response is received or the device is ready
    to accept a new query.

    .. seealso:: LOOP_TIMEOUT: The smaller this interval, the greater the number
        of requests that can be sent. The interval should not exceed 200ms
        otherwise the device will disconnect itself.

    :Example: Usage:

    >>> messages = get_device_messages()
    >>> msg = next(messages)
    >>> while True:
    >>>     if msg:
    >>>         # Get response from device
    >>>         header, response = msg
    >>>         parse_response(header, response)
    >>>
    >>>     # Send command to coroutine
    >>>     # messages.send((5, 0))
    >>>     msg = messages.send(6)

    :return: Coroutine that yields a tuple with (header, response) and accepts
        values: `mode` and `payload` for write queries.
        `mode` is the mode selected on the device to read/write the data.
        `mode` can be set alone if the query is read-only.
